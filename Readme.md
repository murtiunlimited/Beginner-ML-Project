# Churn Prediction Project

Hey there

This is a little project I put together to predict if bank customers might leave (churn) or stay. I played around with a bunch of machine learning models like **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression**, **SVM**, **KNN**, and **Gradient Boosting** to see which one works best. The code doesn’t actually make predictions on new data—it just evaluates different models’ metrics like accuracy, F1 score, etc.

I also checked which features matter the most and scaled everything so the models behave nicely.  

Run it, play with it, and see which model you like the most!  

Happy coding 😎
